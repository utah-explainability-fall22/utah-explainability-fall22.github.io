## Description

Although neural models have obtained great success across various machine learning (ML) tasks in recent years, they are poorly understood. Consequently, people (including ML experts) have little perception of how to control ML systems they interact with and are typically left wondering:

* Which part of the input led to assigning this label?            
* How to change the answer to another?                           
* In plain English, why is this input assigned this label?                        
* Which training examples caused the prediction?                      

In the first part of this course, we'll go over methods that aim to address these questions. These methods are developed by ML researchers, usually without involving experts in other fields and human subjects such as doctors or fact checkers. 

In the second part of this course, we will revisit evaluation of these methods and focus on how to develop and evaluate methods that best accomplish a specific utility of explanations (e.g., they speed-up information search of a fact checker collaborating with a ML model, reduce cognitive load, etc.). Such methods are developed by considering how people explain between each other (extensively studied by social sciences) and conducting application-grounded human-subject evaluations that are common in HCI.  

Methods and examples in this course will heavily focus on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Computer Vision (specifically images)**. This course will _not_ cover global methods that analyze models' average behavior and internals. 

**You must enroll in the class or audit.**

## Calendar

Calendar is **tentative and subject to change**.
More details will be added as the semester continues.

## Resources

* **MS Teams.** Course communication will be via MS Teams.  You should sign into using your uNID and join the "team" for the class by clicking on [this link](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3ait66PgoRabiGRMhXIEr67O1_XTkjExhyqn3rxIf2vI81%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=d69b57e3-80a0-4b92-88fb-a54bd9145bab&tenantId=5217e0e7-539d-4563-b1bf-7c6dcf074f91). It's also the preferred way of communicating with the instructor. Please note that discussion threads and emails are all considered to be equivalent to the classroom, and your behavior in all these venues should conform to the university’s student code.

* **Google Drive.** Course materials, including lectures, reading lists, etc., are in a
  [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13i2Sor2M7it72aGlMd87Iejw6fzqsBxI?usp=sharing) which has been shared with all students. You can access it (only) with your **@gcloud.utah.edu account**. 

## Assignments/Grading

There will be three components to course grades. There are 100 points overall.


* **[Project](assignments/project/) (50 points / 50%).**
    * **Form a project team and submit project team information (2.5pt).**
    * **Submit a project proposal (10pt).** A document no longer than 2 pages, consisting of the following information (following "[Heilmeier Catechism](https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism)"):
      * What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
      * How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice? 
        * The survey of prior work doesn’t need to be complete, but you should include high-level information about how your problem has been approached in the literature. This will help you think about baselines to compare against in your experiments.
      * What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
        * A success can also be showing that a published method does **not** work on a new language, domain, culture, etc.
      * Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make? 
      * What are the risks?
      * What are the intermediate (Nov 3) and final "exams" (Dec 6) to check for success? 
        * You should describe here how you will evaluate your approach. 
        * For a data-driven project, you should describe the data that you have at hand. Ideally, you should have all the data that you need – or have a plan that will get you the data within the next couple of weeks.   
        * If you are working on a standard data set, there is probably a standard evaluation that has been followed in the literature. You could describe this.
        * For a survey paper, you can commit to saying that success is providing X number of new insights. 
        * A successful formalization provides a clearly articulated framework for an old concept.
    * **Submit an intermediate status report (10pt).** A two page document that says what you have done on the project so far. By this time, you should have interacted with the instructor about your project. The report should describe:
      * The progress you have made towards your goal. (This cannot be just "We collected data".) (5pt)
      * Details of your plan for rest of the semester (3pt)
      * Pointers to literature (2pt)
    * **Presentation (12.5pt):** Instead of the final exam, we will have a presentation of the projects in the class. More details as we go along.
    * **Submit a project report (15pt):** A document no longer than 8 pages, structured like a research paper.
      * What problem did you work on? Why is it interesting?
      * What are the important ideas you explored?
      * What ideas from the class did you use?
      * What did you learn?
      * Results (or for theoretical project, proofs)
      * If you had much more time, how would you continue the project?
      * If your project had two members, your report should explain what each of you did.
      * Each of these components will be equally weighted in the report grade.

* **[Paper readings and discussion](assignments/paper_discussions/) (30 points / 30%).**
    * 20pt: Submit discussion questions before class and participate regularly during class. Note that not every question gives you points (e.g., a question cannot be just "What's X?" where X is explicitly described in the paper.)
    * 10pt: Lead at least one discussion.
* **[Paper review](assignments/review/) (20 points / 20%)** Review ACL/EMNLP reviewing guidelines and write a review for a research paper in explainable AI.

Assignments, including discussion questions, have to be submitted **by 11:59pm (Salt Lake City time), unless stated otherwise.**

**Do not submit assignments via email.** Questions for paper discussion have to be submitted to MS Teams. We will announce how to submit other assignments soon.

<!-- * **Late policy.** Students will have 4 late days that may be used for HW assignments at any point during the semseter. Late days may not be used for project benchmarks. After all late days have been used, no credit will be given for homework submitted late. -->

### Late Policy

 All submissions should be made by the deadline. We will use the timestamp on Canvas/Teams as the submission time. Submissions, **except paper discussion**, will be accepted up to 24 hours after deadline, but will be assessed a 10% penalty. That is, if your submission is late and scores 90, then your actual grade will be 81=90-9. 
 
 Submissions will not be accepted 24 hours after the deadline. 
 
 **We will be strict about this policy: If the deadline is midnight and you submit the assignment at 12:01 AM, you will face the 10% penalty!**

### Cheating 

Collaboration is encouraged; cheating will not be tolerated.
    
*<center><u>Honor code for this class</u></center>*
 
> You are encouraged to discuss class materials with your peers. If you want you
> can form study groups because discussions help understanding. You are also
> welcome to discuss assignments.
> 
> However, you must write your own solutions and code and submit your
> own solution. Do not copy or ask for assignments from other students or the
> internet. Do not let someone else copy your submissions either.

If you are caught cheating once, you *will* receive a failing grade for that
submission. If you are caught cheating again, you will fail the class.
 
For projects, you are free to discuss the project with your classmates, but your
work should be your own.
 
For both assignments and the project, you should cite all sources that you refer
to. This includes personal communication, books, papers, websites, etc. Doing so
reflects academic integrity.

### No double dipping projects across multiple classes

You can not submit the same project to this class and another class that you may be taking at the same time. If you are doing related projects in two different classes, there may be some overlap (e.g. in code libraries, etc.), but they should not be identical. A project that is found to be double-submitted will receive zero credit. If you have questions about this policy, please contact the instructor.

## Diversity

It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is our intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.

## SoC Policies and Guidelines  

The class operates under the School of Computing's [policies and guidelines](https://handbook.cs.utah.edu/2019-2020/Academics/policies.php).
