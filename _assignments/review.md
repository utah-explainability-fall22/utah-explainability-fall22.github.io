# Paper Review & Turnin

For a paper you are assigned to review (Canvas > Home > Paper Review > paper_assignment), you should complete   [this form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WQPdjNaMjWr-Dv_mZ_e0BInPM1PgzqnB97p9tY36V4Q/edit?usp=sharing). Please make a copy of this document and send it back to me in any digital way that works for you. However, if you are willing to share your review with others, consider uploading it [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pxyO0ca3QcQOC5KVH-Q7W2w-i6SEK6w6?usp=sharing). I recommend that you all do that, but no pressure. 

Before you start writing the review, carefuly go over [this tutorial](https://aclrollingreview.org/reviewertutorial#strengths-of-the-paper) for more details and useful tips. You will see that the tutorial suggest to **NOT** do the following:

* The authors could also do [extra experiment X]	
* The authors should have done X instead	

For the purpose of this class, feel free to make a note of additional experiments or a different framing in a special section titled "Additional comments for the class".
