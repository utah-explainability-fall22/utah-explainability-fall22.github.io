# Paper Review & Turnin

For a paper you are assigned to review (Canvas > Home > Paper Review > paper_assignment), you should complete   [this form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WQPdjNaMjWr-Dv_mZ_e0BInPM1PgzqnB97p9tY36V4Q/edit?usp=sharing). Please make a copy of this document, fill in the information, and and make sure that the final version is uploaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pxyO0ca3QcQOC5KVH-Q7W2w-i6SEK6w6?usp=sharing). This folder is visible to other students. This simulates real reviewing where your reviews will be visible by other reviews, (senior) area chairs, and program chairs. After the deadline, I recommend looking at other reviews and checking your work. 

Before you start writing the review, carefuly go over [this tutorial](https://aclrollingreview.org/reviewertutorial#strengths-of-the-paper) for more details and useful tips. You will see that the tutorial suggest to **NOT** do the following:

* The authors could also do [extra experiment X]	
* The authors should have done X instead	

For the purpose of this class, feel free to make a note of additional experiments or a different framing in a special section titled "Additional comments for the class". 

## Grading 

* Summary (5 points)
* Strengths (5 points)
* Weaknesses (5 points)
* Comments (2 points)
* Limitations and Societal Impact (2 points)
* Ethical Concerns (1 point)
