# Paper Discussions

10-11 of the class sessions will be devoted to paper discussion. For each session, we will cover
**N papers** by splitting the discussion between N randomly assigned groups which will persist
for the duration of the quarter. N depends on the class enrollment and will be updated when the class starts,

## MS Teams participation

Channels for each group (#paper-discussion-1, #paper-discussion-2, etc.)
will be created. Please join all of the channels, though participation will only be required in
your own.
By the night before each discussion, post 2–3 discussion points 
or questions about the paper in your respective group. Do not repeat earlier questions or points, so
a diversity of issues gets raised. Write each question or point as a separate message, so if people
have responses, follow-up questions, links for related reading, etc., they can reply directly to your
point in a thread. Such follow-up questions or are also a valid way to contribute some of your 2–3
discussion points.

Details of how questions contribute to your grade will be shared soon.

## Class participation
For each class discussion, your group will decide on a discussion leader.
Everyone is required to lead at least one discussion over the course of the quarter. Paper
discussion classes will proceed in two parts. For the first half, each discussion group will break
out and discuss their own paper. The lead should use the discussion points raised in MS Teams to
guide the discussion. Then for the second half, we will reconvene and the lead for each group will
summarize their paper and the takeaways from their discussion.
